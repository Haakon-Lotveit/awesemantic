This is a very simple command-line program that looks up airplanes from a given airport.
Simply call the program like this:
"flyfra [IATA code]" and it will list flights from the RDFS database.
If you don't know the airport's IATA code, use the flyplass, use

SELECT ?airports ?iata WHERE {

?p <http://awesemantic.com/properties/departingAirport> ?iata .

SERVICE <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
?airports <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/iataLocationIdentifier> ?iata .
}

}
